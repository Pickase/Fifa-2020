# Fifa-2020

A data science project for analyzing the skills of football players using machine learning and statistical techniques.

## Project Overview

**Fifa-2020** provides a model to analyze and visualize the skills and attributes of football players. This project uses real-world football player data and leverages the power of Jupyter Notebooks to perform data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, and modeling.

## Features

- Import and clean football player datasets
- Analyze player attributes and skills
- Visualize distributions and relationships between key features
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict or cluster player abilities

## Repository Structure

All code and analysis are contained in Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`). Typical workflow includes:

- **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Import raw data, handle missing values, and prepare for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualize player stats, distributions, and relationships.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features that capture player skills more effectively.
- **Modeling:** Apply ML algorithms (e.g., regression, clustering) to derive insights or predictions.
- **Visualization:** Generate plots to help interpret results.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pickase/Fifa-2020.git
    ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Or install Jupyter if you donâ€™t have it yet:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open one of the project notebooks:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Requirements
