# Fifa-2020
Model for analyze skills of football player


Project Summary:
In this project, we conducted a clustering analysis on football players based on their skills and attributes using FIFA 2020 data.
We explored the dataset and built models using K-means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN to categorize players. 
The performance of the models was evaluated using the silhouette score. 
The analysis aimed to provide insights into player characteristics and aid in finding suitable replacements for players.

Methodology:
Conducted exploratory data analysis to investigate player attributes and strengths using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
Performed data preprocessing by cleaning and processing the data, handling missing values, converting categorical features to numerical, and removing highly correlated features.
Utilized robust scaling to bring features to a uniform scale.
Employed principal component analysis to simplify the complexity of high-dimensional data while retaining trends and patterns.
Applied K-means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN to obtain player clusters.
Evaluated model performance using the silhouette score.

Conclusion:
By employing clustering analysis and principal component analysis,
we categorized football players based on their skills and attributes.
We used K-means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN to form player clusters. 
All three models provided similar results, but DBSCAN showed a higher silhouette score.
The project summary highlighted the key findings and methodologies employed in the analysis.
The insights obtained can be valuable for understanding player characteristics and optimizing team composition in football.
